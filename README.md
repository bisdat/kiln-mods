# Kiln mods

Enshrouded mods using the [Kiln SDK](https://github.com/frostdev-ops/kiln), maintained here as independent projects.

## Survival QoL — first mod

[Survival QoL documentation](SurvivalQoL/README.md) | [Build workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml)

Implements infinite stamina, infinite mana, fast health regeneration, fast mana regeneration, no fall damage and disabled equipment durability loss using Kiln's supported services.

**SDK limitation:** underwater oxygen and frost depletion cannot currently be made truly infinite through the documented API. The mod includes clearly labelled **2× underwater breath** and **2× body heat** options instead.

Build with `bash scripts/build.sh` (requires git, .NET 10 and internet access) or download the `survival-qol` artifact from a successful GitHub Actions run. Configuration is hot-reloadable.

See the mod README for limitations, installation, SDK pin and testing instructions.
